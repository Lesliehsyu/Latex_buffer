HIGH \\
1)Customer switch cost is low, they have a lot of choices.\\
2)Existing companies, such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi has larger number of sellers, their brand is well-known to all
3)Unequal access to distribution channels, considering the weakness of bottler, newcomers have some drawbacks
4)Slow industry growth, it was mentioned in the case (David B. Yoffie, Renee Kim 2) that the market share dropped from 71\% in 1990 to 55\% in 2009, which is not attractive to potential newcomers
\subsection{Supplier Power}
LOW\\
1)Industry participants switching cost is low, it is not difficult for campanies to switch to competing suppliers.

\section{Part III  analysis of the strength of industry forces}
Highly competition in CSD.More people choose non-CSD due to requirement to health life.Other non-CSD try to.the CSD will decreases in short period but in the long term the CSD-industry will keep in certain level since some customers. It has secret recipes, which is hard to imitate.
In our prediction, the area is very profitable.
And according to our research, it is consistent with the reality.

\section{Part IV dynamic thinking}
The Buyer Power is changing the most,specifically,by the development of Internet, products sold online occupy a large proportion. In the other words, buyer can use their advantage to dominate the market.
